                    <h4>DIAMOND HEAD</h4>
                    <p> Diamond Head is a volcanic cone on the Hawaiian
                        island of Oahu that is known for its stunning
                        panoramic views. It is a popular tourist destination
                        and hiking spot, with a steep trail leading to the
                        summit that provides breathtaking views of Waikiki
                        and the Pacific Ocean. The cone was formed over
                        300,000 years ago and is made of tuff, a type of
                        volcanic ash that has solidified. Diamond Head is
                        named as such because 19th-century British sailors
                        believed they had discovered diamonds on the beach
                        at its base.

                        islands. The highlight of the trail is the Makapu'u
                        Lighthouse, which stands on a scenic cliff 600 feet
                        above sea level and has been guiding ships since 1909.
                        The trail is easy to moderate and suitable for all skill
                        levels, making it a popular destination for families.

                        that takes visitors to the USS Arizona Memorial in
                        Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The memorial commemorates
                        the lives lost during the attack on Pearl Harbor on
                        December 7, 1941. Visitors begin at the Pearl Harbor
                        Visitor Center, where they can view exhibits and

                        sunken remains of the USS Arizona. Visitors can pay
                        their respects to the 1,177 sailors and marines who lost
                        their lives and reflect on the impact of the attack on
